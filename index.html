        <p> Coding just helps me be myself. I really like to code. I've learned so much by overcoming the challenges that come with coding. Not only does coding make you a better problem solver but it also teaches you patience, perseverance, and discipline. Coding pushes you outside of your comfort zone in a good way! I really love coding, as it is a great past time as well as I love learning it. My teacher also gets credit for this because she taught me in a really nice way. </p>
